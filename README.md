Kmeans Clustering
=================

A K-Means Clustering (Lloyd's Algorithm) is shown. Right-click to regenerate the random data-set and left click to update centroids.  
 
Note that this is a fork of the GDIWindow project, which was an example building on the abstract class SimpleWindow, which aids creation of simple Win32 windows.
